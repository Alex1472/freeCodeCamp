<form action="https://www.freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo">
    <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL">
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>

Let's add a submit button to your form. Clicking this button will send the data 
from your form to the URL you specified with your form's action attribute.



You can require specific form fields so that your user will not be able to submit your 
form until he or she has filled them out.

<input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL" required> //inside form



Each of your radio buttons can be nested within its own label element. By wrapping an input 
element inside of a label element it will automatically associate the radio button input with the label element surrounding it.

All related radio buttons should have the same name attribute to create a radio button 
group. By creating a radio group, selecting any single radio button will automatically deselect 
the other buttons within the same group ensuring only one answer is provided by the user.

<label> 
  <input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Indoor 
</label>


It is considered best practice to set a for attribute on the label element, with a value that matches 
the value of the id attribute of the input element. This allows assistive technologies to create a linked 
relationship between the label and the related input element. For example:
<input id="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">
<label for="indoor">Indoor</label>

We can also nest the input element within the label tags:
<label for="indoor"> 
  <input id="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Indoor 
</label>


Each of your checkboxes can be nested within its own label element. By wrapping an input element inside of a label 
element it will automatically associate the checkbox input with the label element surrounding it.

All related checkbox inputs should have the same name attribute.

It is considered best practice to explicitly define the relationship between a checkbox input and its corresponding 
label by setting the for attribute on the label element to match the id attribute of the associated input element.

<label for="loving">
  <input id="loving" type="checkbox" name="personality">Loving
</label>


<label for="loving">
	<input id="loving" type="checkbox" name="personality">Loving
</label>
<label for="lazy">
	<input id="lazy" type="checkbox" name="personality">Lazy
</label>
<label for="energetic">
	<input id="energetic" type="checkbox" name="personality">Energetic
</label>



When a form gets submitted, the data is sent to the server and includes entries for the options selected. Inputs of 
type radio and checkbox report their values from the value attribute.
//value на сервер
<label for="indoor">
  <input id="indoor" value="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Indoor
</label>
<label for="outdoor">
  <input id="outdoor" value="outdoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Outdoor
</label>
Here, you have two radio inputs. When the user submits the form with the indoor option selected, the form data will 
include the line: indoor-outdoor=indoor. This is from the name and value attributes of the "indoor" input.
If you omit the value attribute, the submitted form data uses the default value, which is on. In this scenario, if the
user clicked the "indoor" option and submitted the form, the resulting form data would be indoor-outdoor=on, which is 
not useful. So the value attribute needs to be set to something to identify the option.
