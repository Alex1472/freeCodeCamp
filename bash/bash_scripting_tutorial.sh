# INITIALIZATION:
sh script.sh # run script with shell interpreter
bash script.sh # run script with bash interpreter
bash -x test.sh # debug your script.

which bash / sh # bash / sh location
which ls # ls location

# You should add 
#!/bin/bash
# at the top of the script to specify that it is a script for bash, not 
# for sh, dash, ...
# add executable right for all users. Check it with ls -l.
chmod +x script.sh

# VARIABLES:
# In bash variable is always string.
# Create variable (without spaces from left and right of equals). 
# Use "" for values with spaces.
QUESTION1="What's your name?"
# You also can declare variable with
declare QUESTION1="What's your name?" - this two declarations are equivalent.
# Show all varialbles. This list includes all the environment variables, 
# and any others that may have been created in the current shell.
declare -p # show all varibles.
declare -p J # show variable J.
# To get value utilize $variable_name
echo $QUESTION1

# Read variable from console
read NAME
# You can use -p to add a prompt for a user (some text that will be written)
read -p "Enter mission name:" mission_name
# Note, it better to user command line arguments to get data.
# In this case we don't need manual intervention. And, for example, run
# this script from another script.

# Get value
echo Hello $NAME.
# or
echo "Hello $NAME."
# or
echo "Hello ${Name}." # explicitly define variable name.

# You can pass the value of a variable into function
mission_name=mars-mission
mkdir $mission_name

# You can save command output into a variable, user $(command) for this
rocket_status=$(rocket-status $mission_name) # execute command rocket-status
# with mission_name value as argument
# Note, If the output goes over several lines then the newlines are simply removed 
# and all the output ends up on a single line.





# PARAMETERS:
# You can add argument to your script 
./countdown.sh arg1 arg2 arg3
echo $* # show all argument values.
echo $0 # command that started the script
echo $1 # first argument.
echo $? # exit status of last command.	
echo $# # arguments count.
# Note, it is recommended in the script assign every argument to a meaningful
# variable name

# You can separate commands on single line with ";"
# Every command always has exit status. If it equals 0 so there is no errors, 
# otherwise error occurs. 
# You can show exit status of last command this way.
ls; echo $?



# ARITHMETIC OPEERATIONS (( )), EXPR, BC COMMANDS
# (( arithmetic expression )) - the problem is that expression usually 
# returns non-zero value, which logically should be true.
# But bash uses status codes and 0 is true, and other number is false. 
# So (( )) carries out this convertion.
# ((  ))  - evaluates to 0 (shell true), if expression in (( )) not equal 0. 
#           evaluates to 1 (shell false), if expression in (( )) equal 1.
# Double parenthesis peform the calculation. 
# It support most arithmetic C operators.
# You can create a variable here, change other variables.
# All these changes will be visible outside the (( )).
# Note, you SHOULD NOT USE $ for variable value.
A=0
(( A+=10 )) # it not return any value, exit code 10 -> 0
# If you want to get a value use $
I=0
echo "$(( I + 4 ))"
# You can assign the calculated value to another variable.
J=$(( I - 6 ))
# (( )) can contain several operators. You should separate them with comma. 
# It will you return value of the last operator.
(( D = 12, F = 34 )) # 34 will be converted to 0.
# Note, (( )) SUPPORTS ONLY DECIMAL OUTPUT, IT CAN'T RETURN FLOATING NUMBER.
# You can embed the (( )) into a string
echo "Sum is $(( A + B ))"

# You can also use the expr command to calculate arithmetic operation
# But it only supports one operation. It prints value into standard output.
# Note, that the oparator and values should be stricly separated by 
# whitespace.
expr 3 + 5 # 8
# Save result into a variable
B=$( expr 3 + 6 )

# You can use the bc command to evaluate floating point operations
# Add -l flag and pass the input arithmetic string with pipe
echo "3 / 5 + 1" | bc -l



# CONDITIONS:
# For manual use:
# help [[
# help test

# [[  EXPRESSION ]] - return 0 or 1 status code, depending on the evaluation 
# of the conditional expression EXPRSSION.
# It's an operator [[ and some parameters after it. At the end goes ]].
# Spaces in brackets and before and after equals are important.
 
# In [[ ]] you can use:
# ( EXPRESSION )    Returns the value of EXPRESSION
# ! EXPRESSION      True if EXPRESSION is false; else false
# EXPR1 && EXPR2    True if both EXPR1 and EXPR2 are true; else false
# EXPR1 || EXPR2    True if either EXPR1 or EXPR2 is true; else false

# EXPRESSION is test ( [ ] is the same ) expression.

# In test you can use
# -lt, -le, -gt, -ge, -eq, -ne  - arithmetic operators

# <, >, == - string operators
# Use =~ operator for pattern matching.
# [[ "hello" =~ "el" ]] # true
# You can use regular expression, but you should not use quotes for them.
# [[ "hello world" =~ ^h ]] # starts with h

[[ $1 -lt 5 ]] # less then 5.
# And file commands
[[  -a test.txt ]]  -  if test.txt exists


# If exit status for if is 0 then executed. Otherwise else executed.
# In if you can use also test or [ ].

# It's a good practice to use exit codes in your script to indicate to the

# If we don't specify any exit status, then the script will always
# automatically set the exit code to zero.
# We can specify exit code with exit command

# You can get command output with `command`. It return exit code if it has 
# no output else output.
