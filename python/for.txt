For iterates through collection list, tuple, range.
range has 3 attributes start, end, step. End is not included.
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)
# 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

for i in range(1, 6, 2):
    print(i)
# 1, 3, 5


You can use else to execute code exact after loop:
for i in range(1, 6, 2):
    print(i)
else:
    print('The loop has ended!')
	
You can use pass in loop:
for x in [0, 1, 2]:
  pass
