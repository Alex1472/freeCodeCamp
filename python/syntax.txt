Python use indentation to indicate a block of code.
if 5 > 3:
    print('a')

The number of spacing is up to you:
if 5 > 3:
 print('a')
 
You can't skip indentation
if 5 > 3:
print('a')
#incorrect

You should use the same number of spacing the same block of code:
if 5 > 3:
    print('a')
  print('b')
#incorrect



Comments start with #
print('a')
# It's a comment



Python ignores string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string
(triple quotes) and place you comment inside:

"""
Some text
Another text
"""
print('a')
