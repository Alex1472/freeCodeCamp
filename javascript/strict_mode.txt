STRICT MODE

The strict mode tighten the rules for certain behaviors that usually works in javascript. In usually works because of backcompatibility. For example
function f() {
	i = 0;
	console.log(i); //it create a global variable i. There is no error.
}


In strict mode will be an error. To activate strict mode and 'use strict' at the top of the file.
'use strict'
function f() {
	i = 0;
	console.log(i); //it create a global variable i. There is an error.
}

Also deleting variables is not allowed in strict mode.
"use strict";

let x = 0;
delete x; //error, but it works in normal mode.
