COMPARATION OPERATORS:
<, <=, >, >=, ==, ===, !=, !==

They return boolean.
console.log(3 > 2); //true


Strings is compared lexicographically. They compared with Unicode character codes.
console.log( 'Я' > 'А' ); 

If we compares string, bool or number they will be converted into number.
console.log("2" > 1); //true
console.log(true == "1"); //true


=== - compares types before converting to number.
console.log(0 === false); //false
console.log(false === false); //true


Compararion with null and underfined:
With == null and undefined are equal and not equal to any other value.
With === null and undefined are not equal.

With >, >=, <, <=  null and undefined will be converted into number (0, NaN).
console.log(null > -1); //true

Note that NaN not >, < or == anything even NaN, therefore
console.log(underined > 0); //false
