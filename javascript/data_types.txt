DATA TYPES

There is several data type in js:
number
BigInt
string
boolean
null
undefined - a value wasn't assigned
object
symbol


typeof 
typeof return string with a name of object.
typeof "aa" //"string"
typeof("aa");// the same

typeof null //"object" - official error in javascript
typeof alert //"function" - function is an object


Variable in javascript can keep different types.
let s = 1;
s = "test"; //correct



NUMBER:
Interger or with floating point number.
let n = 123;
n = 12.345;

Special values:
Infinity, -Infinity, NaN.
Operations with NaN return NaN.
NaN * 2 //NaN
Except
NaN ** 0 //1

You don't get fatal error with math operations, in worst case NaN.
Number can't keep values geater then 2^53-1. In this case number with floating point will be used.


BIGINT:
You can use BigInt in this case. You should add n at the end of the number.
const bigInt = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;
